Facebook Marketing Analytics Professional Certificate
Coursera
Introduction to Data Analytics

These are the jupyter notebooks for 'Python for Data Analysis',  week two lesson videos.

Since, course organizer did not share the Notbooks, I have just wrote for practice. 

Would later add Notebooks for Week 3 'Data Cleaning and Processing' and perhaps for week 4, as well.

Please feel free to make improvements.
